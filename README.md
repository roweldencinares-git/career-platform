## 🎨 Design Patterns

This project follows proven patterns from a production coaching booking system:

1. **Service Layer Architecture**
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Reusable business logic
   - Transaction-safe operations

2. **Type Safety**
   - Full TypeScript coverage
   - Database schema types
   - Strict null checks

3. **Component Structure**
   - Server Components (default)
   - Client Components (when needed)
   - Atomic design principles

4. **API Routes**
   - RESTful conventions
   - Error handling
   - Validation with Zod
