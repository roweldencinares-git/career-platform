## üèóÔ∏è Development Best Practices

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript strict mode** - No `any` types
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Auto-format on save
- **Component structure** - Atomic design pattern
- **API routes** - RESTful conventions
- **Error handling** - Try-catch blocks, user-friendly messages
- **Comments** - Document complex logic

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature branch naming
feat/client-applications-crud
feat/resume-upload
feat/coach-dashboard

# Commit message format
feat(applications): add create application API endpoint
fix(resumes): resolve upload file size limit issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions
```

### Testing Strategy (Optional but Recommended)
- **Unit tests** - Critical business logic
- **Integration tests** - API endpoints
- **E2E tests** - Key user flows (Playwright)

### AI Development Approach
- **Claude Code** for rapid development
- **Code review** before committing
- **Understand AI-generated code** - Don't blindly accept
- **Refactor** - Improve AI suggestions
